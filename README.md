# Spreadsheet

I... I don't know why I made this exactly. One day, I thought, "Would I be able to build spreadsheet software?" And then I did it.

You can find the application: https://spreadsheet.robinmalfait.com

## Features

### General

- You can write normal text in a cell
- You can write a number in a cell
   - This is actual text, but will be coerced to a number
- You can write a formula in a cell
   - Formulas are prefixed with `=`

Once you write a formula, you will get some syntax highlighting.
